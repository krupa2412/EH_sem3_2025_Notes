# üì° API (Application Programming Interface)

## üîç What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be made, what data formats to use, and how different components interact.

In simple terms, an API acts like a **messenger** that takes requests from one system, tells another system what to do, and returns the response.

Example: When you log in using Google on a third-party app, that app is using Google‚Äôs API to authenticate your credentials.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of APIs

- **REST API** ‚Äì Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), commonly used on the web.
- **SOAP API** ‚Äì Uses XML messages and is more structured.
- **GraphQL** ‚Äì Allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **WebSocket API** ‚Äì Enables real-time communication.

---

## üéØ Uses of APIs

- **üîó Integration**: Connect different systems or services (e.g., payment gateways, social logins).
- **üí¨ Communication**: Enable software components to talk to each other.
- **üì° Data Access**: Retrieve or send data from/to servers or databases (e.g., weather, news, stock APIs).
- **üì¶ Automation**: Trigger actions or workflows (e.g., sending emails, scheduling tasks).
- **üõ†Ô∏è Microservices**: Connect and coordinate between independent services in distributed architectures.

## üß™ Example Use Case

A weather app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current temperature data by sending an HTTP request like:

# üìò GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) ‚Äì Notes

## üß† What is GROQ?

**GROQ** stands for **Graph-Relational Object Queries**.  
It is a powerful, JSON-native query language developed by **Sanity.io** to retrieve and transform structured content.

Unlike SQL (used for relational databases) or GraphQL (schema-based queries), GROQ is designed specifically for **document-based data** and **headless CMS systems**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- üîç **Filter** documents with conditions: `*[_type == "post"]`
- üéØ **Project** specific fields: `{ title, publishedAt }`
- üîÅ **Follow references** to linked documents: `author->`
- üìè **Slice results** like arrays: `[0..4]`
- üßπ **Sort data** using `order()`: `order(publishedAt desc)`
- üß± **JSON-native**
