- *Network*: Group of connected devices.
- *IP Address*: Internet address for a device.
- *MAC Address*: Hardware ID of a device (physical address).

---

## IPv4
- *32-bit* address format.  
- Example: 192.168.1.1

### Private IP Ranges:
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

## Static vs Dynamic IP

- *Static*: Set manually, doesn't change.
- *Dynamic*: Assigned by router, can change.

---

## Port Forwarding
- Sends data from a *router’s public port* to a *device inside the network*.
- Used for *hosting games, websites*, etc.

---

## Payload & Backdoor

- *Payload*: The harmful part of malware (runs after system is hacked).
- *Backdoor*: A secret way to get into a system.

---

## UAC (User Access Control)
- Windows feature that *asks for permission* when software tries to make big system changes.

---

## Recon (Information Gathering)

- *Passive*: No contact with target (e.g., Google search).
- *Active*: Direct contact (e.g., Nmap scan).

### Websites for Info Gathering:
- [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) → Check if email/password is leaked  
- [archive.org](https://archive.org) → See old versions of websites (Wayback Machine)  
- [weakpass.com](https://weakpass.com) → Lists of weak passwords

## Kali Linux - Nmap Commands

### Useful Flags/Options:
- -Pn → Don’t ping target, assume it’s up  
- -A → Aggressive scan (OS, services, etc.)  
- -sV → Find versions of services running  
- -O → OS detection  
- -oN → Save output to file  
- --script → Run scripts (e.g., for finding vulnerabilities)  
- -vv → More detailed output  
- -p → Specify ports (e.g., -p 1-1000)  
- -sS → Stealth (SYN) scan  
- -sT → Full TCP connect scan  

### Example Command:
```bash
nmap -Pn -A -sV -O --script vuln -vv -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1
